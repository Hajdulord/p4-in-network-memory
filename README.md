# P4: In-Network Memory

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to implement an in-network memory management system using MININET/BMv2 environment and a Python test code as proof of concept to demonstrate that the P4 code works.

## Running the code

The directory with this README also contains a Makefile, JSON files for configuration, the P4 code, as well as the Python test code.

As a first step, compile the `inmemory.p4` and bring up a switch in Mininet to test its behavior.

1. In your shell, run:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will:
   * compile `inmemory.p4`, and 

   * start a Mininet instance with one switch (`s1`) connected to two hosts (`h1`, `h2`) defined by the topology.json.
   * The hosts are assigned IPs of `10.0.1.1` and `10.0.1.2`.

2. We've written a simple Python test program that will allow to test out the functions of the switch. You can run the test program directly from the Mininet command prompt:

```
mininet> h1 python client.py
>
```

3. The test program will enter into a new prompt, into which you can type basic expressions. It will then parse your expression, and prepare a packet accordingly. This packet will then be sent to the switch for processing. When the switch returns the result of the operation, the test program will print the result.
